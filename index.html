                    <h2>Coming Home To New Friends</h2>
                    <P>
                        Once upon a time, in the land of 2011, there was
                        a young puppy found roaming the streets of Houston.
                        She was about 4 months old, and a gangly and 
                        peculiar sort of dog. Looking at her, she was 
                        more legs, ears, and wrinkles than any one 
                        person could really tell what to do with. Even still,
                        roaming about the streets doing whatever it is 
                        puppies get up to, is a very freeing way to spend
                        one's time, and so it was with a great stroke of 
                        unlukiness that the puppy found herself snatched up
                        by dog catchers and whisked away to the pound.

                    <P>
                        Even though the pound was the worst type of place, 
                        with the best kind of people, Tiny soon found herself 
                        in a new home, with new people and dogs. Some who were 
                        very excited that she'd come the live and stay, and 
                        others who were decidedly less excited. But nevertheless,
                        she made some wonderful new friends.
                        There was her human, Rhema, Tiny liked her best since she 
                        was always taking her outside (and being a puppy with a 
                        tiny bladder meant LOTS of early wake up calls), spending 
                        time with her, and feeding her. Her human had other human friends
                        that lived with them too, and they were always so hapy to pet
                        her, sneak her treats, or (her favorite) snuggle up with her. Best of
                        all, Tiny got to live with other dogs too! There was Oreo, or Douglas 
                        O'Callihan as she was known to her more formal acquaintences, and Resse.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And so she got to know all of her new friends, and Tiny was happy.

                    <h2>Finding New Adventures</h2>
                    <P>
                        Over the next few years, Opelusa went on many adentures.

                        She had sleepovers with Doug.
